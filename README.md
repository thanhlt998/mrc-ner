## Install Requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

We build our project on [pytorch-lightning.](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning)
If you want to know more about the arguments used in our training scripts, please 
refer to [pytorch-lightning documentation.](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Prepare Datasets
You can [download](./ner2mrc/download.md) our preprocessed MRC-NER datasets or 
write your own preprocess scripts. We provide `ner2mrc/mrsa2mrc.py` for reference.

## Prepare Models
For English Datasets, we use [BERT-Large](https://github.com/google-research/bert)

For Chinese Datasets, we use [RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm)

## Train
The main training procedure is in `trainer.py`

Examples to start training are in `scripts/reproduce`.

Note that you may need to change `DATA_DIR`, `BERT_DIR`, `OUTPUT_DIR` to your own
dataset path, bert model path and log path, respectively.

## Evaluate
`trainer.py` will automatically evaluate on dev set every `val_check_interval` epochs,
and save the topk checkpoints to `default_root_dir`.

To evaluate them, use `evaluate.py`
